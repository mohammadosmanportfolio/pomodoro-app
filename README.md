# pomodoro-app
A small app I made to help with time management and procrastination

When you start the timer, the countdown to 25 minutes begins and you work. Then you take a 5 minute break. You have four 25 minute work sessions,
three 5 minute short breaks, and one 20 minute long break. This is how it would look like:

25 minutes of work
5 minute break
25 minutes of work
5 minute break
25 minutes of work
5 minute break
25 minutes of work
20 minute break

I made this app to learn more about Tkinter and using it to make GUI apps.
